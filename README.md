<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Dominik</h1>

I'm a Computer Science student who started with programming, but lately I’ve been diving deeper into the broader IT world: Linux, servers, networking, and cybersecurity. I don’t see it as just "skills" — more like experimenting, learning and having fun with technology.

## 🔍 What I’m into right now
- Playing with **Linux** on a daily basis — admin stuff, troubleshooting, scripting.  
- Exploring **networking** tools (like `nmap`) and learning how systems talk to each other.  
- Building and securing small **home lab environments** (VMs, services, monitoring, firewalls).  
- Automating repetitive tasks with simple scripts.  
- Still keeping some love for **web & coding** (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, React basics, C++).  

I’m not claiming to be an expert — I just enjoy poking around IT, breaking things in safe environments, and figuring out how to fix them again.

## 🛠 Tech & Tools I touch
- **Programming / Web:** HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, React, C++  
- **Sysadmin / Infra:** Linux (daily driver), servers, networking, backups, monitoring  
- **Security playground:** nmap, basic pentesting tools, service hardening, ethical hacking in labs  
- **Other fun:** shell scripting, containers, automation

## 🌍 Beyond IT
When I’m not glued to a terminal, you’ll probably find me:  
🥊 Training martial arts  
🏋️ Hitting the gym  
🏐 Playing volleyball recreationally
